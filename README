# Falcon BMS Picos
This project adds an Object Oriented way to program picos for a Falcon BMS simulation setup using C++.

This can be used in parralel with my other project [FalconBMSToSerial](https://github.com/LucyV4/FalconBMSToSerial) which sends the memory data from Falcon BMS to serial ports.

## Requirements
To compile you will need any valid arm c++ compiler. For my setup I installed `gcc-arm-embedded` and `make` using [Chocolatey](https://community.chocolatey.org/).

## Credits
The `display.h` was adapted from [LedDisplay](https://github.com/PaulStoffregen/LedDisplay) by Paul Stoffregen. The font used in `display.h` was made by Pascal Stang.
